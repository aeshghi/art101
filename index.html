		<h1>Ali Eshghi</h1>

		<p>Hey there! My name is Ali Eshghi, I am born and raised in Iran.
			 I moved to the United States in 2018 and continued my education as a
			 junior in high school. I am mostly an intovert person, but I really enjoy
			 outdoor activities such as snowboarding, hiking, cycling and etc. I am
		 	 also such a big fan of video games and I think that this industry is
		 	 more toward an interactive game art between the developer and the gamers
