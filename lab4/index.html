	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	<p> The idea of this lab was to get us familiarized with the concept of Pseudoncoding
		and give us the habbit of making a pseudocode for a program beforee we start it
		and how it can help and improve our programming and brainstorming</p>

	<p> Process of pseudocoding an everyday task </p>

	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p>One of the problems that was given to us in this lab was to try to pseudocode
		a high-level computer task that we have in mind to to create, and create a clear
		image of what it does and what features does it need to have to be considered
		as complete</p>

	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p>At the end of this lab, we came to an end of creating a author block on
	top of the java-script source of the file for the program, and at the end we
  add the pseudocode as comment in the program </p>

		//
		// Creating a web-site for buying and reselling video games:
		//  Display the name and the image of all the games available

		// 3. Validate user move
		// 4. Evaluate possible moves
		// 5. Choose computer move
		// 6. Test of win or draw condition
