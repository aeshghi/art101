		<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
		<p>Working with a partner, we will be experimenting on functions that will
			be getting input from the user.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>We had some problem with reading in the input from the user and also
			printing them out from the .js file to the .html file.
			Some of the other problems: I had to check was the problem with splitting the
			string into array of characters and also joining them into one string again.
			Also one of the problems that we faced during processing of soring on the
			 string and array of chars, was calling the helper functions the right way,
			 As well as getting the output to appear on the screen. Some of the
		  challenges were new but satisfying, for example, I could solve the problem
			of removing the whitespaces by figuring out a new helper function.</p>
		<p>The program uses .toLowerCase() function that transforms all the uppercase
			 letters to lowercase letters of the alphabets in the string, the way that
			 it converts all the	string to lower-case and then does the sorting process
			 on it.</p>
		<p>The program uses .replace() function to remove all the white spaces from
			the string that was used as input</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>None :)</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p> Here is the program execution where the function reads in the input from
			the user, and sorts the the input by order and prints the output</p>
