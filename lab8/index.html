		<h1>Lab 8 - Anon functions and callbacks</h1>
		<p>Working with a partner, experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks
		</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>I had a to play around with document.write() and the function caller to
			get them to work properly. Also I had to experiment a little bit with
			console.log to get the result to appear on the console.</p>
		<h2>Result</h2>
		<p>Refer to the console to checkout the output :)</p>
